# 🧙‍♂️ Dev-Spellbook

Welcome, wanderer.  
This is my **grimoire of development knowledge** — a place where spells, rituals, and ancient runes of code are gathered.  
Here you’ll find commands, scripts, and tricks that I’ve learned and want to keep safe, as if they were magical incantations.  



## 📜 Purpose

The **Dev-Spellbook** is meant to be:  
- A **personal grimoire** where I store useful commands, notes, and guides.  
- A way to **document my learning journey** and make sure the knowledge doesn’t fade.  
- A collection of **scripts and rituals** to summon power in the dev world.  



## ⚔️ How to Use

- Browse the notes as if you were flipping through **arcane pages**.  
- Copy the spells (commands/scripts) and adapt them to your rituals.  
- Use them wisely. Some spells may require **root powers** 🧙‍♂️.
